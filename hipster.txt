The SRoC TCM will deliver subsistence charging for three regimes calculating the charges based on data obtained from the three EA systems:

PAS		- Permit Administration System
CFD 		- Charging for Discharge
WABS		- Waste Billing System

This is the Solution Design Document for the transfer of CFD Invoice files both to and from the TCM.
Currently CFD calculates all Invoice charges internally and writes the Invoice extract files to the Secure S Drive from where they are moved to the DMZ, picked up via Autosys by Shared Services Connected Ltd (SSCL) and made available to Single Operating Platform (SOP).
SOP requires the Invoice files to maintain the current comma separated value format and additional charging data has been mapped to the CFD file copybook as agreed with SSCL.
